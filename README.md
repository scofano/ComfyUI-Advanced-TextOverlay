# üñãÔ∏è ComfyUI Advanced Text Overlay

**Repository:** [scofano/ComfyUI-Advanced-TextOverlay](https://github.com/scofano/ComfyUI-Advanced-TextOverlay)

**Forked from:** [munkyfoot/ComfyUI-TextOverlay](https://github.com/munkyfoot/ComfyUI-TextOverlay)

**Originally inspired by:** [mikkel/ComfyUI-text-overlay](https://github.com/mikkel/ComfyUI-text-overlay)

This node extends and refines the classic ComfyUI Text Overlay concept with a **re-engineered rendering engine**, **precise alignment logic**, **new customization parameters**, and **enhanced batch handling** ‚Äî making it the most advanced text overlay solution available for ComfyUI.

---

## ‚ú® Key Improvements & New Features

### üß± 1. Rebuilt Rendering Engine

* Fully restructured text rendering logic for higher precision and cleaner anti-aliasing.
* Pixel-accurate bounding box calculations ensure text aligns perfectly to the intended position.
* Consistent stroke behavior across font sizes with improved blending and color stability.

### üé® 2. Extended Styling and Layout Control

* **Line spacing** and **padding** parameters for advanced multi-line composition.
* **Independent X/Y shifting** for fine-tuned manual positioning.
* **Full hex color control** for both text fill and stroke.
* Supports transparent overlays for non-destructive compositing.

### üß≠ 3. Smarter Alignment and Positioning

* Expanded support for:

  * Horizontal alignment: `left`, `center`, `right`
  * Vertical alignment: `top`, `middle`, `bottom`
* Reliable anchor-based alignment even on varying resolutions and batch images.

### üî† 4. Font Management

* Custom fonts can be loaded directly from the repo‚Äôs `/fonts` directory.
* Supports both `.ttf` and `.otf` formats.
* Graceful fallback to a system font if a specified font is unavailable.

### ‚öôÔ∏è 5. Batch and Workflow Enhancements

* Native **batch support** ‚Äî automatically applies consistent overlay logic across all input images.
* Optimized performance and memory use when processing large image sets.
* Node parameters persist and preview correctly in ComfyUI sessions.

### üß© 6. Developer & Extensibility Features

* Modularized code for easier maintenance and feature additions.
* Clean separation between text layout and rendering logic.
* Ready for further extensions such as shadow layers, gradient text, or dynamic variable injection.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To install the **Advanced Text Overlay** node:

1. Locate your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory.
   Typically found at:

   ```
   ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
   ```
2. Clone this repository into that directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/scofano/ComfyUI-Advanced-TextOverlay
   ```
3. Restart ComfyUI.
   The node will appear under the **`image/text`** category as **‚ÄúAdvanced Text Overlay‚Äù**.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Add the **Advanced Text Overlay** node to your ComfyUI workflow.
2. Connect your image source to the node‚Äôs **image input**.
3. Configure text and style parameters:

   * Text content
   * Font and size
   * Fill and stroke colors
   * Alignment, spacing, and offset adjustments
4. Connect the node‚Äôs output to your desired destination (e.g., preview, save image).
